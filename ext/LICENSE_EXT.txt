# Caracal provides pre-compiled binaries of projects that are external and not part of Caracal. In most cases you can easily replace/switch the binaries around and do as you wish.
# Although, in respect to the original authors of external libraries that Caracal may utilize, this file serves as a comprehensive list of resources for info about each dependency,
# or at the very least the author/company.
